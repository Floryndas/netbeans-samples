Netbeans Platform samples

Here you'll find fully working Netbeans Platform based application demos on how to accomplish different pretty standard application features.

## nodes/node-samples
Shows a BeanTreeView backed by a SQL database through a loosely coupled DAO implementation. 
The BeanTreeView shows a tree structure of Categories (nodes).

The Nodes have the following capabilities added to them
* Create new child category
* Rename category
* Delete/remove category

Through WeakListeners registered on the entity classes the UI is kept current.
